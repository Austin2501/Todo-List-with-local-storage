# ToDo List with Local Storage

## Overview

This project is part of my 12Weeks12Projects challenge, where I'm diving into web development. For Week 3, I've crafted a ToDo list with local storage functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now, even if you refresh the page, your tasks stay intact!

## Features

- **Persistent Data:** Your ToDo list remains unaffected even after a page refresh.
- **Sleek UI/UX:** A clean and user-friendly interface for a seamless experience.
- **Inspiration:** Special thanks to [Tyler Potts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-potts-535698100/) for the insightful tutorials that guided this project.
